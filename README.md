Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze the historical performance of a specific stock. Through this analysis, I aim to understand the stock's price trends, volatility, and any key financial indicators that might influence its future performance.

Tools

For this project, I've used Python as the primary programming language, leveraging Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis. The data manipulation and visualization aspects are handled using Pandas, Matplotlib. Historical stock price data is obtained through the Yahoo Finance API.
